This document will describe the comprehensive flow of the MollyAI application, detailing every user journey and significant feature.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

The journey for a new user starts at the MollyAI landing page, which is visually engaging using Envato templates, consistent with Shopify Polaris guidelines. The user can initiate the sign-up process by clicking on a 'Get Started' button, leading to a registration page where they can sign up using their email or social media accounts like Facebook and Google for a smoother experience. For those just exploring, a live demo option is available without the need for an account. After registration, users receive a confirmation email with a link to complete the setup. There’s a 14-day free trial that prospective users can use to explore the Pro Plan features.

Once set up, returning users can sign in through the primary sign-in page. In case of a forgotten password, users can request a password reset link via email. Signing out is simple and accessible from the user’s profile menu, ensuring a secure exit from the service.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Upon successfully signing in, users are directed to the main dashboard. The dashboard functions as the central hub, offering an overview of the user's campaigns with real-time analytics. The page is neatly divided with a sidebar for navigation, a header displaying key metrics such as ROAS (Return On Ad Spend) and CTR (Click-Through Rate), and a main content area showcasing recent and active campaigns. Here, users can view AI-generated insights, personalized recommendations, and alerts about performance such as budget overruns or high-performing opportunities. The design ensures an intuitive pathway for users to navigate various sections of the app, facilitating smooth transitions between campaign management, analytics, and reporting features.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

### Automated Campaign Management

Within the dashboard, users can access the campaign management section via the sidebar. Here, they can upload their ad creatives including images, videos, or text. MollyAI uses AI to optimize these creatives, suggesting improvements based on predicted engagements. Users can then select from these optimizations and initiate A/B testing for different ad variations. The AI automatically deploys the ads across chosen platforms like Facebook, Google, TikTok, and Shopify with one-click functionality.

### AI-Powered Personalization

MollyAI adapts to each user through AI and machine learning, providing personalized insights that offer tailored recommendations on targeting and budget allocations. This section highlights data-driven suggestions uniquely curated based on the historical performance of previous campaigns.

### Advanced Analytics

In the analytics section, accessible via the sidebar, users gain deeper insights into their campaign performance. This includes customer demographics, purchasing trends, and competitor benchmarks. MollyAI's intelligent backend alerts users to creative fatigue, suggesting new ad variations to maintain audience engagement.

### Campaign Prediction Models

Users can review potential campaign performance metrics before launching a campaign. The prediction models estimate ROAS, CTR, and provide budget efficiency scores. This enables businesses to make pre-emptive adjustments ensuring the best ROI.

### Seamless Ad Lifecycle Management

Every campaign's lifecycle is thoroughly managed within MollyAI, from creative upload and AI optimization to campaign launch and continuous monitoring. The application’s AI suggests dayparting and seasonal optimizations in real time, ensuring that ads are served at optimal times to the targeted audience.

### Terminal Commands

Advanced users can interact with the application using a unique terminal interface available in the settings. Here, natural language processing powered by OpenAI GPT allows users to issue commands like "Pause all campaigns with ROAS < 2," or "Create a $500 CBO campaign targeting yoga enthusiasts," giving them more control over their ad management without navigating multiple interfaces manually.

## Settings and Account Management

Users can manage personal information and preferences within the settings section, accessed from the user profile menu. This includes updating email addresses, changing passwords, and configuring notification settings. Users can also manage their subscription, choosing from different pricing plans like Pro, Pro+, or Enterprise, each offering varying feature access and levels of support.

For managing billing information, the settings page provides options for updating payment methods and reviewing transaction history. After making adjustments in this section, users can easily return to the main dashboard, ensuring uninterrupted access to campaign management tools.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

When users input incorrect data or face connectivity issues, MollyAI provides clear and concise error messages within pop-ups or dedicated error pages. If a user attempts a restricted action, contextual help and suggestions are offered to guide them back to a valid operational path. For instance, failing to upload creatives due to size constraints results in an advisory prompt detailing allowed formats and sizes.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The user journey in MollyAI begins with a seamless onboarding process and progresses through insightful campaign management and advanced analytics, all supported by AI-driven functionalities. This journey empowers Shopify merchants and e-commerce businesses to enhance their ad efficiency through data-backed decisions, predictive analytics, and real-time optimizations, thereby achieving greater revenue.
