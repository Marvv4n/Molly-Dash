### Introduction

A well-organized file structure is crucial for any software project as it lays the foundation for efficient development and collaboration among team members. In the case of MollyAI, a sophisticated AI-powered ad management platform, a clearly defined file structure ensures that developers can easily navigate the codebase, collaborate effectively, and maintain the system over time. This document will outline the proposed file organization for MollyAI, aligning it with the projectâ€™s tech stack and requirements to support streamlined operations and future scalability.

### Overview of the Tech Stack

MollyAI employs a modern tech stack tailored to handle complex ad management operations seamlessly. The frontend is built with React and the Polaris framework to maintain a consistent UI, especially for Shopify users. The backend leverages Node.js with Prisma for building RESTful APIs that manage campaign and user data. Supabase/PostgreSQL serves as the database, providing a robust platform for data management. AI functionalities are powered by OpenAI GPT API and Google Vertex AI, ensuring advanced natural language processing and machine learning capabilities. Hosting is initially handled by Replit, facilitating easy collaboration and integration of a custom domain. This tech stack informs the file structure by requiring clear separations of concerns among frontend, backend, and AI modules while ensuring scalability.

### Root Directory Structure

The root directory of MollyAI's project contains the primary folders and essential configuration files to support the entire application. The main directories include `frontend/` for UI components and assets, `backend/` for server-side logic, `database/` for schema definitions and migrations, and `ai-services/` for integrating AI models and APIs. Key configuration files are also present at the root level, such as `package.json` for managing Node.js dependencies, `.env` for environment-specific variables, and documentation files like `README.md` to provide an overview of the project.

### Frontend File Structure

The frontend directory is structured to promote reusable components and maintainable styles. It typically includes a `components/` folder where individual UI elements are developed, a `styles/` directory for maintaining stylesheets or CSS-in-JS solutions, and an `assets/` folder for static resources like images and fonts. This modular structure ensures that components can be easily updated or reused across different parts of the application, facilitating an efficient development process that aligns with modern React practices.

### Backend File Structure

MollyAI's backend directory is crafted for scalability and ease of maintenance. It organizes code into distinct sub-folders such as `routes/` for defining API endpoints, `controllers/` for handling business logic, `models/` for data structures and interactions with the database, and `services/` for utilitarian functions or interactions with third-party APIs. This structure is designed to separate concerns, making the system extensible and ensuring that teams can work on various parts of the backend without hindering overall functionality.

### Configuration and Environment Files

Configuration and environment files are crucial for managing application settings and operational conditions. The `config/` directory might contain configurations for different application environments (development, staging, production) and third-party API keys, ensuring secure and efficient access. The `.env` file should be used to manage sensitive environment variables, which are imported using tools like dotenv for runtime access, keeping credentials and keys safe.

### Testing and Documentation Structure

To ensure high-quality delivery, MollyAI employs a comprehensive testing structure. The `tests/` directory houses unit and integration tests that validate the functionality of both frontend and backend components. Testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha can be leveraged here to automate testing processes. Furthermore, `docs/` will contain user manuals, API documentation, and developer guides to facilitate knowledge sharing and onboarding of new collaborators or users, ensuring everyone has access to up-to-date information.

### Conclusion and Overall Summary

The delineation of a clear and organized file structure in the MollyAI project is instrumental in supporting its development and continuous maintenance. By aligning with the chosen tech stack and adhering to best practices, this organized framework not only simplifies the ad management process but also paves the way for future expansions and integrations. This ensures MollyAI remains robust and user-friendly, cementing its position as a leading AI-driven ad management solution.
