## Purpose of System Prompts

System prompts are integral to AI interactions, defining the manner and tone of the responses generated by the AI. They ensure consistency, relevance, and accuracy in the AI's output, directly influencing the user experience. In the context of MollyAI, these prompts are not only crucial for delivering personalized insights and recommendations but also for handling creative optimizations and campaign management tasks seamlessly. Clarity and specificity are paramount in crafting these prompts to ensure they are aligned with the user's needs and real-time campaign objectives.

## Prompt Structure and Guidelines

The prompts are structured to be clear, concise, and contextually aligned with the AI tasks they are designed to address. This involves using straightforward language, avoiding technical jargon, and maintaining a professional yet approachable tone. Prompts should directly relate to the relevant task, such as campaign optimization or budget recommendations, ensuring the AI’s responses are actionable and precise. Employing feedback loops within prompts helps refine the AI’s understanding and output, enhancing the interaction quality.

## Core System Prompts

The core system prompts guide the AI in handling tasks such as:

*   **Campaign Management:** "Optimize ad placement for highest predicted engagement."
*   **Creative Recommendations:** "Suggest variations for A/B testing based on current ad performance."
*   **Performance Monitoring:** "Alert user if the campaign budget is approaching limit."

For each use case, the prompt directs the AI to focus on key metrics, ensuring outcomes like improved Engagement Rate or Cost Efficiency.

## Role-Specific Prompts

MollyAI adapts to various roles, such as a customer support representative or ad optimization assistant. For instance:

*   **Customer Support Role:** "Provide detailed feedback on why a campaign is underperforming, including potential solutions."
*   **Ad Optimization:** "Analyze competitor benchmarks and suggest improvements to current strategy."

These role-specific prompts enable the AI to interact tailored to the user's specific needs, whether providing strategic advice or handling customer inquiries.

## Dynamic Prompts

Dynamic prompts adjust based on user inputs and real-time data. For instance:

*   "Predict ROAS for the following budget increases by 10%, 20%, and 30%."

These prompts help the AI offer customized, data-backed insights that adapt to changing campaign parameters and user-driven queries.

## Error Handling Prompts

Error handling prompts maintain the fluidity of interactions when issues arise. Examples include:

*   "System unable to fetch data from the selected ad platform, please check network connection or API settings."
*   "There appears to be a discrepancy in data input; please verify campaign metrics for consistency."

These prompts help guide users out of problematic situations, ensuring minimal disruption in ad management.

## Feedback and Improvement

User feedback is an essential component of refining system prompts. MollyAI will implement feedback mechanisms that allow users to rate the relevance and helpfulness of AI responses. This feedback loop will help in adjusting prompt structures and enhancing AI training models to improve overall platform efficiency and user satisfaction continuously.

## Conclusion and Overall Summary

System prompts are pivotal in guiding MollyAI’s interactions, providing a structured framework that enhances user experience while ensuring real-time optimization of advertising campaigns. By focusing on clarity, role specificity, and adaptability, these prompts differentiate MollyAI from other platforms, empowering Shopify merchants and e-commerce businesses to achieve superior ad management outcomes.
